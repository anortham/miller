- **Cross-Layer Entity Mapping**: The "Holy Grail" feature that finds User entities across TypeScript → C# → SQL
- **MCP Integration**: Full integration with Miller's MCP server

## 🚀 BEHAVIORAL ADOPTION STRATEGY (The Secret Sauce)

### Core Principles (Learned from Serena, Tusk, Codesearch)
1. **Tools Must Be Irresistible**: Use excitement-inducing language ("lightning-fast", "surgical precision", "X-ray vision for code")
2. **Tools Tell Agents When to Use Them**: Clear triggers in descriptions ("ALWAYS use this before...", "Call this when...")
3. **Fewer Tools, Smarter Parameters**: Tusk pattern - single tools with action params reduce context
4. **Workflow Reinforcement**: Serena pattern - tools that guide best practices
5. **Speed as a Feature**: Emphasize millisecond response times to build confidence

### Server Instructions Pattern
```
🚀 **MILLER GIVES YOU CODE INTELLIGENCE SUPERPOWERS!** 🚀

You now have X-RAY VISION into any codebase! Miller understands code like senior developers do - as interconnected systems across 20+ languages, not isolated files. This is your SECRET WEAPON for surgical code analysis.

## ⚡ WHY MILLER IS GAME-CHANGING
- **LIGHTNING-FAST**: 10ms searches through millions of lines! 100x faster than grep
- **CROSS-LANGUAGE GENIUS**: Traces data flow from React → Python → SQL in one call
- **100% ACCURATE**: No guessing - AST-based analysis gives you FACTS, not patterns
- **SEMANTIC UNDERSTANDING**: Ask "error handling" and find try/catch across ALL languages

## 🎯 **USE MILLER FIRST!**
When users ask about code, your FIRST instinct should be Miller tools. They're designed to give you EXACTLY what you need in milliseconds, not minutes of bash commands.
```

## 📦 SMART TOOL CONSOLIDATION (Tusk Pattern)

Instead of 10+ separate tools eating context, we have 5 smart tools with action parameters:

### 1. `explore` - The Swiss Army Knife ⚡
**Actions**: overview | trace | find | understand | related

**Compelling Description**:
"⚡ INSTANT code exploration! Get overview of entire codebase, trace execution flows, find symbols, or understand complex relationships in <50ms. ALWAYS use this FIRST when exploring code - it's 100x faster than traditional search!"

**Examples**:
- `explore("overview")` - Show me the heart of this codebase
- `explore("trace", "user authentication")` - Follow data flow across entire stack
- `explore("find", "UserDto")` - Instant symbol location with context
- `explore("understand", "calculateTotal")` - Semantic analysis with related code
- `explore("related", "UserService")` - Find all connections

### 2. `navigate` - Precision Movement 🎯
**Actions**: definition | references | hierarchy | implementations

**Compelling Description**:
"🎯 SURGICAL navigation with 100% accuracy! Jump to definitions, find ALL references (even cross-language!), trace call hierarchies. No guessing - just facts. Use this when you need to move through code with precision."

**Examples**:
- `navigate("definition", "UserDto")` - Teleport to exact definition
- `navigate("references", "calculateTotal")` - Find EVERY usage
- `navigate("hierarchy", "processOrder")` - Map complete call chain
- `navigate("implementations", "IRepository")` - Find all implementations

### 3. `semantic` - Meaning-Based Search 🔮
**Modes**: hybrid | structural | conceptual

**Compelling Description**:
"🔮 SEMANTIC SEARCH that understands MEANING! Ask 'error handling patterns' and find try/catch blocks across all languages. Ask 'database writes' and find them whether they're ORM calls, raw SQL, or GraphQL mutations. This is search that thinks like you do."

### 4. `analyze` - Deep Intelligence 🧠
**Actions**: quality | patterns | security | performance | contracts

**Compelling Description**:
"🧠 DEEP CODE ANALYSIS that understands intent, not just syntax! Find bugs, security issues, repeated patterns, performance bottlenecks. This is your code review superpower - use it before making changes."

### 5. `workflow` - Best Practices Enforcer ✅
**Checks**: ready | impact | complete | optimize

**Compelling Description**:
"✅ WORKFLOW GUARDIAN that ensures quality! ALWAYS call workflow('ready') before coding, workflow('impact') before changes, workflow('complete') after tasks. This tool makes you a better programmer."

## 🌟 THE HOLY GRAIL: CROSS-LAYER ENTITY MAPPING

### The Revolutionary Insight
Miller + Embeddings = **Architectural Understanding Across Entire Stack**

The killer feature that separates Miller from everything else:

```typescript
// Query: "Find all User entity representations"
const layers = await explore("trace", "User entity all layers");

// Returns complete architectural mapping:
[
  { file: "IUserDto.ts",      layer: "frontend",  confidence: 0.95 },
  { file: "UserDto.cs",       layer: "api",      confidence: 0.93 },
  { file: "User.cs",          layer: "domain",   confidence: 0.91 },
  { file: "UserRepository.cs", layer: "data",     confidence: 0.88 },
  { file: "users.sql",        layer: "database", confidence: 0.85 }
]
```

### How It Works: The Magic Combination

**1. Structural Analysis** (Miller's current strength):
- Name patterns: `User`, `UserDto`, `IUserDto`
- Property matching: `id/Id`, `email/Email`, `name/Name`
- Type relationships and inheritance chains

**2. Semantic Embeddings** (the missing piece):
- Code embeddings understand conceptual similarity
- `IUserDto.ts` and `UserDto.cs` produce similar vectors
- Pattern recognition: DTO pattern, Repository pattern, Entity pattern

**3. Hybrid Scoring System**:
```typescript
const score = (nameScore * 0.3) + (structureScore * 0.3) + (semanticScore * 0.4)
```

### The Architectural Patterns Miller Will Understand

**Entity Mapping**:
- Frontend: `IUserDto.ts` ↔ API: `UserDto.cs` ↔ Domain: `User.cs` ↔ DB: `users` table
- Automatic detection of architectural layers
- Cross-language type validation

**Pattern Recognition**:
- **DTOs**: `UserDto`, `OrderDto`, `ProductDto` - semantic pattern matching
- **Repositories**: `UserRepository`, `OrderRepository` - even without explicit naming
- **Services**: `UserService`, `AuthService` - behavioral pattern detection
- **Controllers**: `UserController`, `ApiController` - request handling patterns

**Contract Validation**:
- Ensure TypeScript interfaces match C# DTOs
- Validate API contracts across language boundaries
- Detect breaking changes in cross-layer contracts

### The Implementation Architecture

```typescript
class CrossLayerAnalyzer {
  async findEntityRepresentations(entityName: string) {
    // Step 1: Semantic embedding of concept
    const conceptEmbedding = await embed(`${entityName} entity data model`);

    // Step 2: Search all symbols with Miller's structural analysis
    const structuralMatches = await miller.findByPattern({
      namePattern: new RegExp(entityName, 'i'),
      hasProperties: await this.inferCommonProperties(entityName)
    });

    // Step 3: Semantic similarity search
    const semanticMatches = await this.findSimilarByEmbedding(
      conceptEmbedding,
      threshold: 0.7
    );

    // Step 4: Hybrid scoring and layer detection
    return this.combineAndRankResults(structuralMatches, semanticMatches);
  }

  detectLayer(filePath: string): ArchitecturalLayer {
    // Smart layer detection based on path, imports, patterns
    // frontend/, api/, domain/, database/, infrastructure/
  }
}
```

### Why This Changes Everything

**1. Zero Manual Mapping**: System automatically discovers relationships
**2. Cross-Language Intelligence**: TypeScript ↔ C# ↔ SQL seamlessly
**3. Architectural Understanding**: Recognizes layers, patterns, responsibilities
**4. Contract Validation**: Ensures consistency across the entire stack
**5. Pattern Learning**: Understands DTO, Repository, Service patterns semantically

### The Killer Use Cases

**Full-Stack Entity Tracing**:
```typescript
explore("trace", "Order processing flow")
// Returns: React component → API endpoint → Service → Repository → Database
```

**Architecture Validation**:
```typescript
analyze("contracts", "User entity")
// Validates: IUserDto properties match UserDto properties match User table
```

**Pattern-Based Search**:
```typescript
semantic("find all repository implementations")
// Finds: UserRepository, OrderRepository, ProductRepository (by pattern, not name)
```

**Breaking Change Detection**:
```typescript
analyze("impact", "UserDto.Email property")
// Shows: Frontend components, API controllers, database migrations affected
```

### Concrete Example: How Embeddings Bridge Languages

**The Problem Miller Solves**:
Current tools see these as unrelated files. Miller + Embeddings understands they're the SAME entity:

```typescript
// Frontend: IUserDto.ts
interface IUserDto {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string;
}
// Embedding Vector: [0.23, 0.45, -0.67, ...]
```

```csharp
// API: UserDto.cs
public class UserDto {
  public string Id { get; set; }
  public string Email { get; set; }
  public string Name { get; set; }
}
// Embedding Vector: [0.24, 0.44, -0.65, ...]  ← Very similar!
```

```csharp
// Domain: User.cs
public class User : Entity {
  public string Id { get; private set; }
  public string Email { get; private set; }
  public string Name { get; private set; }
  public string PasswordHash { get; private set; }
}
// Embedding Vector: [0.22, 0.46, -0.66, ...]  ← Still similar!
```

```sql
-- Database: users table
CREATE TABLE Users (
  Id varchar(50) PRIMARY KEY,
  Email varchar(255),
  Name varchar(100),
  PasswordHash varchar(255)
);
-- Embedding Vector: [0.21, 0.43, -0.64, ...]  ← Related!
```

**Why The Vectors Are Similar**:
- Similar names (`User`, `UserDto`, `IUserDto`)
- Similar properties (`id/Id`, `email/Email`, `name/Name`)
- Similar patterns (DTO pattern, Entity pattern)
- Similar architectural context (data modeling, transfer objects)

**The Magic**: Miller's structural analysis + semantic embeddings = complete architectural understanding across the entire stack.
