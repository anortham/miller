### 💼 Next Session Priorities

If starting a new session or after context reset:

1. **Immediate** - Complete database tests (fix parameter counts)
2. **Short-term** - Add Python language support (user has "long list" to add)
3. **Medium-term** - Expand to Rust, Go, Java, C/C++
4. **Long-term** - Advanced semantic features and performance optimization

### 🤝 Collaboration Notes

- User is very engaged and has specific requirements
- Emphasis on comprehensive testing before language expansion
- User has a "long list" of languages they want to add
- Focus on professional, production-ready quality
- Previous issues were quickly identified and fixed with user feedback
